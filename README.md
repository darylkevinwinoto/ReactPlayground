# React Playground

Welcome to my React Playground repository! This repository serves as a dedicated space for honing my React skills and working on various coding tutorials from different sources.

## Branch Structure

- The `master` branch contains the React template, which serves as a starting point with a basic "Hello, World!" content.
- For each completed topic or tutorial, I create a separate branch named after the title of the corresponding subject matter.

## Branches

Here are some of the branches available in this repository:

- [master](https://github.com/piangevole/ReactPlayground/tree/master): The React template with the initial "Hello, World!" content. Done in 21/7/2024
